# BitCrusher Effect Error Report

## Issue Description
The BitCrusher effect is producing poor audio quality described as "horrible" with static noise instead of proper bitcrushing effect.

## Current Implementation Status
✅ Syntax errors fixed - BitCrusher now initializes without JavaScript parsing errors
✅ Deployment compatibility resolved - Using Blob URL approach instead of file imports
✅ Algorithm restored - Using the same quantization formula from the original working commit
✅ Build successful - No TypeScript or build errors

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: Audio Quality Issue
- **Symptoms**: Static noise instead of proper digital distortion
- **Affected Component**: BitCrusher AudioWorklet processor
- **Error Message**: None (initializes successfully but produces poor audio)

## Suspected Causes
1. **Quantization Algorithm**: The current formula `Math.round(inputSample * quantizationSteps) / quantizationSteps` might not be producing proper bitcrushing
2. **Sample Rate Reduction**: The phase counter implementation might not be working correctly
3. **Parameter Passing**: Values might not be correctly passed from the main thread to the AudioWorklet
4. **Buffer Processing**: Audio buffers might not be processed correctly in the worklet

## Technical Details
- **Original Commit**: 4715fdd694ce6d2a1798ff748e4e8a9b0c20cfa5
- **Current Approach**: Inlined AudioWorklet code using Blob URL
- **Algorithm**: `Math.round(inputSample * quantizationSteps) / quantizationSteps` with `quantizationSteps = Math.pow(2, Math.floor(Math.max(1, bits))) - 1`
- **Sample Rate Reduction**: Phase counter with `samplesPerUpdate = Math.max(1, Math.floor(44100 / targetSampleRate))`

## Recommendations
1. Verify the quantization algorithm produces proper stepped values
2. Test with different bit settings (1-16) to see if any produce expected results
3. Check sample rate reduction implementation with different target rates
4. Compare output with known working bitcrusher implementations
5. Consider reverting to ScriptProcessorNode approach if AudioWorklet continues to have issues
